# Add_To_Cart

1. **Set Up React Project**: First, you need to set up a React.js project. You can do this using create-react-app or any other method you prefer.

2. **Create Components**: Create the necessary components for your application. In this case, you'll likely need a product listing component to display the items available for purchase, and a cart component to display the items added to the cart.

3. **State Management**: Set up state management to handle the data for your application. You can use React's built-in state management or libraries like Redux or Context API for more complex applications. You'll need to manage the state of the products available and the items in the cart.

4. **Display Products**: Render the products available for purchase in your application. You can fetch this data from an API or hardcode it for simplicity.

5. **Add to Cart Functionality**: Implement the functionality to add items to the cart when the user clicks an "Add to Cart" button. This will involve updating the cart state with the selected item.

6. **Display Cart**: Render the items added to the cart in the cart component. You'll need to display the name, quantity, and any other relevant information for each item.

7. **Update Cart**: Implement functionality to update the cart, such as increasing or decreasing the quantity of items, or removing items from the cart altogether.

8. **Calculate Total**: Calculate the total price of items in the cart and display it to the user.

9. **Styling**: Style your components to make them visually appealing and user-friendly.

10. **Testing**: Test your application to ensure that the "Add to Cart" functionality works as expected and that there are no bugs or issues.

11. **Deployment**: Once you're satisfied with your application, deploy it to a hosting service so that users can access it.
